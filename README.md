# Pandas_LinearRegression
Linear Regression:

Trained with X_train and y_train.
Outputs coefficients, intercept, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and 
𝑅
2
R 
2
 .
k-Nearest Neighbors:

Features are scaled using StandardScaler.
kNN trained with X_train_scaled and y_train.
Default k=5 for predictions, with evaluation using MSE and 
𝑅
2
R 
2
 .
Optimal k Search:

Tests k values from 1 to 20.
Plots the relationship between k and MSE for selection.
Scatter Plot:

A simple scatter plot visualizes the relationship between population and year.
Key Outputs:
Linear Regression:

Coefficients of features.
Model performance (MSE and 
𝑅
2
R 
2
 ).
kNN:

Performance metrics (MSE and 
𝑅
2
R 
2
 ).
Graph to determine the best value of k.
